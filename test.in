pick up a big red block
grasp that pyramid
find a block which is taller than the one which you are holding
put it into the box
what does the box contain
what is the pyramid supported by
how many blocks are not in the box
is at least one of them narrower than the one which I told you to pick up
is it supported
stack up two pyramids
stack up both red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid
which cube is sitting on the table
is there a large block that is behind a pyramid
put a small one onto the green cube which supports a pyramid
put the littlest pyramid on top of it
does the shortest thing that the tallest pyramid's support supports support a thing which is green
which colour is it
how many things are on top of green cubes
had you touched any pyramid before you put the green one on the little cube
why did you do that
why did you clear off that cube
how did you do it
how many objects did you touch while you were doing it
what did the red cube support before you started to clean it off
how many blocks were to the left of the box then
put the blue pyramid on the block that is in the box
put the blue pyramid that is on the block in the box
is there any thing which is bigger than every pyramid but which is not as wide as the thing that supports it
a steeple is a stack which contains two green cubes and a pyramid
are there any steeples now
build a steeple
have you picked up the biggest block
quit
can the table pick up blocks
can a pyramid be supported by a block
can a pyramid support a pyramid
