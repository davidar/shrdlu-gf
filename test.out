pick up a big red block
holding(big red block)!

grasp that pyramid
holding(that pyramid)!

find a block which is taller than the one which you are holding
block tall.holding?

put it into the box
in(that, box)!

what does the box contain
contains'.box?

what is the pyramid supported by
supports.pyramid?

how many blocks are not in the box
#count(block ~in.box)?

is at least one of them narrower than the one which I told you to pick up
#any(that narrow.history$goal$holding)?

is it supported
#any(supports.that)?

stack up two pyramids
stack(pyramid, pyramid)!

stack up both red blocks and either a green cube or a pyramid
stack(red block, green cube | pyramid)!
stack(red block, red block, green cube | pyramid)!

which cube is sitting on the table
cube on.table?

is there a large block that is behind a pyramid
#any(big block behind.pyramid)?

put a small one onto the green cube which supports a pyramid
on(small, green cube supports.pyramid)!

put the littlest pyramid on top of it
on(#most(small, pyramid), that)!

does the shortest thing that the tallest pyramid's support supports support a thing which is green
#any(#most(short, supports'[supports[#most(tall, pyramid)]]) supports.green)?

which colour is it
colour.that?

how many things are on top of green cubes
#count(above[green cube])?

had you touched any pyramid before you put the green one on the little cube
#any(pickup.pyramid before[put_on[green, small cube]])?
#any(pickup.pyramid before[put_on[green, small cube]])?

why did you do that
why.that?

why did you clear off that cube
why[cleanoff[that cube]]?

how did you do it
how.that?

how many objects did you touch while you were doing it
#count(pickup. during.that)?

what did the red cube support before you started to clean it off
supports'[red cube, before.cleanoff.that]?

how many blocks were to the left of the box then
#count(block left_of[box; during.that])?

put the blue pyramid on the block that is in the box
on(blue pyramid, block in.box)!

put the blue pyramid that is on the block in the box
in(blue pyramid above.block, box)!

is there any thing which is bigger than every pyramid but which is not as wide as the thing that supports it
#any(#each(big, pyramid) wide'.supports.that)?

a steeple is a stack which contains two green cubes and a pyramid
steeple(set(stack contains[pair(green cube, green cube)], pyramid)).
steeple(stack contains[set(pair(green cube, green cube), pyramid)]).

are there any steeples now
#any(steeple holds.now)?

build a steeple
steeple!

have you picked up the biggest block
#any(holding[#most(big, block)])?

quit
